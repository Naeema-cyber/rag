    "## Exercise 1: Build Your Own Agentic RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Build an agentic RAG system on a topic of your choice (NOT biochemistry - use your own domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Suggestions\n",
    "- Technology tutorials (Python, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
    "- Agriculture\n",
    "- Finance\n",
    "- Historical documents\n",
    "- Study notes from a course\n",
    "- Recipe collection\n",
    "- Legal documents (simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Document Collection**\n",
    "- Gather 5-10 documents (PDF or TXT) in your chosen domain\n",
    "- Documents should be substantial (5000+ words each)\n",
    "- Topics should be related but distinct\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Vector Store Setup**\n",
    "- Load documents using appropriate loader\n",
    "- Split into chunks (experiment with chunk size)\n",
    "- Create Chroma vector store with embeddings\n",
    "- Test retrieval with sample queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Retrieval Tool**\n",
    "- Create `@tool` decorated function for retrieval\n",
    "- Use MMR or similarity search\n",
    "- Return formatted context\n",
    "- Include metadata in responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Agentic RAG System**\n",
    "- Build LangGraph with agent and tool nodes\n",
    "- Implement conditional edges (agent decides when to retrieve)\n",
    "- Add conversation memory\n",
    "- Create helpful system prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Testing & Evaluation**\n",
    "- Test with 10 diverse queries:\n",
    "  - 5 that require retrieval\n",
    "  - 5 that don't require retrieval\n",
    "- Document which queries trigger retrieval\n",
    "- Evaluate answer quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebook with complete implementation\n",
    "2. Test results showing agent decisions\n",
    "3. Brief report (300-500 words):\n",
    "   - What domain did you choose and why?\n",
    "   - How did you tune chunk size?\n",
    "   - Did the agent make good retrieval decisions?\n",
    "   - What worked well? What needs improvement?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example System Behavior\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"What is Python?\"\n",
    "Agent Decision: NO retrieval needed (general knowledge)\n",
    "Response: \"Python is a high-level programming language...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: \"How do I use the new API endpoint for user authentication?\"\n",
    "Agent Decision: YES, retrieve from documentation\n",
    "Response: [Retrieved docs] \"Based on the documentation, the new authentication endpoint...\"\n",
    "```\n"
